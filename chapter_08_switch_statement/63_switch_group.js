 * FILE SUMMARY / NOTES
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Topic: Grouping multiple case labels in a switch statement — demonstrates how
 *        several values can share the same execution block without repetition.
 *
 * Functions/Methods Used:
 *   - console.log(message: any): void
 *     Description: Prints the given value to the standard output (console).
 *     Input: Accepts any data type as a direct value, variable, or expression.
 *     Return Type: void (undefined) — returns nothing; only outputs to console.
 *   - let browser: string
 *     Description: Declares a block-scoped variable named browser and initializes it with a string value.
 *     Input: Receives a variable name and an optional initial value directly assigned via =.
 *     Return Type: undefined (no return; it binds a value to an identifier in the current scope).
 *
 * Built-in Methods/Keywords Used:
 *   - switch (expression)
 *     Description: Evaluates an expression and matches its value against case labels using strict equality (===).
 *     Input: Accepts an expression, variable, or direct value to evaluate and compare.
 *     Return Type: void (undefined) — does not return a value; controls program flow.
 *   - case value
 *     Description: Labels a block of code; multiple consecutive case labels can point to the same block.
 *     Input: Receives a literal value, variable, or expression to compare against the switch expression.
 *     Return Type: void (undefined) — does not return a value; serves as a flow-control label.
 *   - break
 *     Description: Immediately exits the nearest enclosing switch, loop, or labeled statement.
 *     Input: No input required; used as a standalone keyword.
 *     Return Type: void (undefined) — does not return a value; only alters control flow.
 *   - default
 *     Description: Labels a block of code to execute when no case matches the switch expression.
 *     Input: No input required; used as a standalone keyword in a switch statement.
 *     Return Type: void (undefined) — does not return a value; serves as a fallback flow-control label.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 *   - Case grouping (fall-through by design): Stacking case labels without break between them causes them to share the same block.
 *   - Common behavior for related values: Useful when different inputs should trigger the same logic (e.g., browsers based on Chromium).
 *   - Strict equality matching: switch uses === to compare the expression with each case value.
 *   - console.log: Used to output the classification of the matched browser group.
