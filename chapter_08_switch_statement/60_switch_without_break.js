 * FILE SUMMARY / NOTES
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Topic: Switch statement without break — demonstrates fall-through behavior where
 *        execution continues through subsequent cases once a match is found.
 *
 * Functions/Methods Used:
 *   - console.log(message: any): void
 *     Description: Prints the given value to the standard output (console).
 *     Input: Accepts any data type as a direct value, variable, or expression.
 *     Return Type: void (undefined) — returns nothing; only outputs to console.
 *   - let day: number
 *     Description: Declares a block-scoped variable named day and initializes it with a number value.
 *     Input: Receives a variable name and an optional initial value directly assigned via =.
 *     Return Type: undefined (no return; it binds a value to an identifier in the current scope).
 *
 * Built-in Methods/Keywords Used:
 *   - switch (expression)
 *     Description: Evaluates an expression and matches its value against case labels using strict equality (===).
 *     Input: Accepts an expression, variable, or direct value to evaluate and compare.
 *     Return Type: void (undefined) — does not return a value; controls program flow.
 *   - case value
 *     Description: Labels a block of code to execute when the switch expression strictly matches this value.
 *     Input: Receives a literal value, variable, or expression to compare against the switch expression.
 *     Return Type: void (undefined) — does not return a value; serves as a flow-control label.
 *   - default
 *     Description: Labels a block of code to execute when no case matches the switch expression.
 *     Input: No input required; used as a standalone keyword in a switch statement.
 *     Return Type: void (undefined) — does not return a value; serves as a fallback flow-control label.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 *   - Fall-through behavior: When break is omitted, execution falls through to the next case block until break or the end of switch.
 *   - Strict equality matching: switch uses === (strict equality) to compare the expression with case values.
 *   - Default case: Executes when none of the case values match the switch expression.
 *   - console.log: Built-in method used to print output for demonstration.
